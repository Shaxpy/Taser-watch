# Taser-watch
This is my team's attempt to make women feel much safer in public places!

The Idea

• Seems like a normal digital watch from outside.
• After activation, if a person touches the metal contacts, he shall
be electrocuted for a second or two.
• Proper Insulation and measures taken to prevent self-
electrocution.

This watch has been linked with the Ardinode App, and shows the status of the taser, whether it is activated or not!

Also the Location , Latitude, and longitude can be seen of the taser on the app

The SmartPhone and Watch interact through Bluetooth only!

Early Prototype

So, we made it and won a Hackathon for the same which led us to believe this idea seems feasible so we are working on decreasing the size of the watch and designing smaller circuits!
